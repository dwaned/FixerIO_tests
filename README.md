# FixerIO_tests
This repository contains a testing framework to test the Fixer.IO API

1. You can find the Postman collection and environment under the folder called FixerIO_Postman
2. The details about the implementation for Part 2 are below.


#### Implementation

Using a boilerplate project from an open-source framework called [Dtective](http://dtective.io), it contains a Maven solution using Apache HTTPClient library for HTTP communication and Cucumber as a BDD layer.

The ApiTests.feature under *src/test/resources/quality/FixerIO/* contains the required scenario for Part 2.

The custom step used in the test can be found under *src/test/java/io/dtective/quality/framework/CustomSteps.java*

#### Configuration

The base URL for the site and API of Fixer.IO can be found in *build/environment/testEnvironment.json*.
To be able to use these URLs, the value for the *TestEnvironment* settings under *build/environment/environment.properties* is set to *env-fixer*.  


#### How to run

1. Make sure you have Maven installed.
2. To run the test, execute this command in the root of this project:

    `mvn compile test "-Dcucumber.options=--tags @fixer"`
    
3. To generate the report, execute:

    `mvn site`
    
    Access the report by opening:
    
    `target/site/allure-maven-plugin/index.html`
    
The CSV file generated by the test can be found in the project root with the name currencies.csv.
